Use the app folder provided, fill-in the `app.py` file with the code from your notebook (make necessary changes if needed). 

Then, view your streamlit app by running ```streamlit run app/app.py``` from the app's home directory.

Streamlit is using port 8501 by default. Install Ngrok and create a tunnel between your localhost 8501 and Ngrok's web service.
